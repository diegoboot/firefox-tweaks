# firefox-tweaks
An attempt to make Firefox suck less. 

Unlike other resources out there, this repo isn't mainly about privacy/security<sup>1)</sup>, but more generally about browser speed, UI/UX issues, and getting rid of unnecessary bloatware.

**Do not change any of these settings without understanding what they're doing. This repo isn't meant for inexperienced users.** 

This repo is meant as an additional resource to improve aspects of Firefox, after you've done all the standard steps to ensure a base level of security. Have some basic security/privacy addons installed (uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript, Disconnect, Self-Destructing Cookies, etc.), run a decent firewall, maybe browse over a VPN, maybe have a decent hosts file, and so on. And, most important of all: use your brain while browsing, don't just click on random stuff.

Once you've done that, you probably don't need stuff like "safe browsing" and similar, which gives a somewhat false sense of security (and sends data to Google).

To apply these tweaks, type `about:config` in the URL bar, and use the config search bar to look up the individual settings.
